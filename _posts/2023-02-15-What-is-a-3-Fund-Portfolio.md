A 3-fund portfolio is a simple just use three mutual funds or ETF(exchange-traded funds). With just three funds, an investor can build a diversified, low cost portfolio that’s easy to manage.

3-fund portfolio is a “Lazy Portfolios”, initially popularized by the Bogleheads, but don’t let the simplicity fool you. A three fund portfolio has outperformed most comparable actively managed portfolios over the past several decades. 

## How to build a 3-Fund Portfolio?
A 3-fund portfolio consists of just three mutual funds. The three funds cover U.S. stocks, international stocks and U.S. bonds.

### U.S. Stocks
The U.S. stocks portion of the portfolio typically consists of a total market index fund. These funds invest in virtually all of the available public companies headquartered in the United States. An example of such a fund would be the Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund (VTSAX).

In some cases, an investor can choose to substitute an S&P 500 Index Fund in place of a total market stock index fund. The historical returns and volatility of a total U.S. market index fund and S&P 500 Index fund are very similar. While I prefer a total stock market fund in a three fund portfolio, this may not be an option inside of a 401k or other workplace retirement account. In those circumstances, an S&P 500 Index fund is a perfectly sound alternative. 

### International Stocks
For the international stocks, there are many total international stock index funds that one could use. I’ve invested in Vanguard’s Total International Stock Index Fund (VTIAX) for years. This fund invests in public companies headquartered outside of the United States, including in both developed countries (e.g., Germany and France)  and emerging markets (e.g., Brazil and China).

###U.S. Bonds
For the bond portion of the portfolio, an index fund focused on U.S. bonds is typically used. For example, the Vanguard Total Bond Market Fund (VBTLX) would make an ideal investment for the three fund portfolio. This fund seeks to track the investment performance of the Bloomberg Barclays US Aggregate Float-Adjusted Index.  This index broadly tracks the government and investment-grade U.S. bond market.

## Is a 3-Fund Portfolio Diversified?
At first glance, the three fund portfolio may not seem well-diversified. With just three funds, one can mistakenly believe that it’s too narrowly focused. Here it’s important to remember that one cannot determine the diversification of a portfolio based on the number of mutual funds or ETFs in the portfolio. I’ve seen investment advisors put clients in more than 20 funds, and yet have very little diversity.

In the case of the three fund portfolio, it is extremely diversified. For equities, it includes companies headquartered in both the United States and throughout the world. It includes both large companies and small companies. And while the bond portfolio invests just in U.S. bonds, it covers both government and corporate bonds. 

In fact, each of these funds represent investments in thousands of stocks and bonds:

Vanguard Total Bond Market Index Fund:  10,025 bonds
Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund:  3,640 stocks
Vanguard Total International Stock Index Fund:  7,361 stocks.

So Yeah, a three fund portfolio is diversified.
