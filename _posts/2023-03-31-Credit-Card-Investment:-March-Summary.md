## Summary

Finally the market is recovering due to the recent Feb print more money. 
The recent PCE also better than expectation. So we are having a strong market again in April. 

I feel FED would raise the interest again in May of .25 percent. It will be the last raise, and then will start down the rate. through out the year. 

So I will be expection the market will continue raise until May, and then raise again in second half! 

So lets expect a bullish market soon!
