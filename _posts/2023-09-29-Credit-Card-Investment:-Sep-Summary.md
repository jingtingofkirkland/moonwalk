## Summary

In September 2023, my investment portfolio experienced mixed performance. Some of my funds, notably FXAIX, demonstrated robust growth, with its value increasing from the initial investment of $5000 to $5232.99. However, other investments like FZILX and FXNAX faced minor losses, resulting in a decrease in the overall portfolio value. BABA and BYDDY also saw declines, contributing to a challenging month. Additionally, a cash-out fee of $300 further impacted the portfolio negatively. Overall, my portfolio faced fluctuations, showcasing the inherent volatility of the market.
