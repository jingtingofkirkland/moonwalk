Early this month, I got an promotional cash advanceoffer with 0% APR last for over a year. 

Then a idea came up to my mind that what if I get the cash out and invest with the it for a year, what will happen? 

I know it might not be a good idea, and I am not an investment expert, but I really want to do a POC myself, Becaues if my investment anually return could beat the 3% transaction fee, then I could actually earning money. So I would like to take the risk and see what will happen. 

## My plan: 

1. take the cash out and invest with it some index funds.
2. hold the invest for a year
2. update the invest status montly and share with post


## Investment Strategy
My investment strategy is simple, I will just use the 3 fund portfolio. It is only need to selete three index funds which includes:

* A domestic stock index fund
* An international stock index fund
* A bond index fund

With three-fund portfolio I could achived simplified diversification with moderate risk and moderate cost. By tracking an entire benchmark or market index, I can gain exposure to all of the assets in that index.

## Learnings 
There are couple of learnings that I did't know unitl i tried the credit card cash advance. 

1. You need to pay transaction fee upfront, for me its 3%, which means I already lost 3% even before I began actual investment. 
2. Once you take the cash advance, then you will lose your purchase grace period, which means your card will charge your interest immediately after you make any purchase, even you had 0% APR for cash advance. 
3. It might hard your credit store, If you keep the  utility is high. My credit score already droped due to the cash advance, but not sure how will it impact my credit score in long run.  I will also keep update my credit score status. 

Plese expect my coming montly posts about the investment.
