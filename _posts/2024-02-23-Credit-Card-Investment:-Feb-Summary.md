## February Investment Portfolio Update

Greetings, everyone! Feb is marked as the last Month of our Year Investment with Credit card. While even our 0% APR Money haven't expired yet, but I started clean up some of the assets. 

### Feb

We clean up the BABA and BYDDY, which is has sink for a while. We will keep the rest untill when we start paying off our credit card balance, probably March.
