title: What is a dividend ETF
---
A dividend ETF is a type of exchange-traded fund (ETF) that invests in stocks that pay regular dividends. The ETFs aim to provide investors with exposure to a diversified portfolio of dividend-paying companies while also offering the benefits of an ETF structure, such as liquidity, flexibility, and tax efficiency.

Dividend ETFs are popular among income-seeking investors who want to generate regular income from their investments without having to pick individual stocks. These ETFs typically hold a basket of stocks that have a history of paying dividends, and the ETF provider may also use a rules-based approach to select stocks with a certain level of dividend yield, growth, or other criteria.

## Benefits
One potential benefit of dividend ETFs is that they may offer more stable returns than non-dividend-paying stocks, which can be more volatile. Dividend-paying stocks also tend to be more mature and financially stable companies, which may provide investors with a measure of safety in their portfolio.

## What is qualified dividend v.s. ordinary dividend

Qualified dividends and ordinary dividends are two different types of dividends that can be paid by corporations to their shareholders, and they are taxed differently. Here's a brief explanation of each:

Qualified dividends: These are dividends that meet certain criteria set by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). To be considered qualified, a dividend must be paid by a U.S. corporation or a qualified foreign corporation, and the shareholder must have held the stock for a minimum holding period. For most stocks, this holding period is at least 60 days within a 121-day period that begins 60 days before the ex-dividend date. Qualified dividends are taxed at the same rates as long-term capital gains, which are generally lower than ordinary income tax rates.

Ordinary dividends: These are dividends that do not meet the criteria to be considered qualified. They can be paid by U.S. or foreign corporations, and there is no holding period requirement. Ordinary dividends are taxed as ordinary income, which means they are subject to the same tax rates as wages, salaries, and other types of income.

The tax treatment of qualified and ordinary dividends can have a significant impact on the after-tax return of an investment. Therefore, it's important to understand the type of dividends that a stock or ETF pays before making an investment. It's also important to note that tax laws and rates can change over time, so it's a good idea to consult with a tax professional to fully understand how your investments will be taxed.

## Risk of invest in dividend ETFs

Investing in dividend ETFs carries certain risks. While dividend-paying stocks can offer investors a potential source of regular income, they are still subject to market risks and volatility.

Here are some of the risks to consider when investing in dividend ETFs:

1. Market risk: The value of the ETF can be affected by changes in the stock market, including declines in stock prices and overall market downturns.

2. Sector concentration risk: Some dividend ETFs may be concentrated in certain sectors, such as utilities, consumer staples, or real estate. If one or more of these sectors experiences significant negative changes, the ETF's performance may be affected.

3. Interest rate risk: Rising interest rates can make bonds and other fixed-income securities more attractive to investors, which can cause stocks and ETFs to underperform. Dividend stocks are often used as a substitute for bonds, so if interest rates rise significantly, the demand for dividend-paying stocks may decrease.

4. Dividend reduction or elimination risk: Even companies with a history of paying dividends can reduce or eliminate their dividend payments in response to changes in the business environment or financial performance. This can result in a reduction in income for investors and a decline in the ETF's value.

5. Liquidity risk: If the ETF holds stocks that are illiquid or difficult to trade, it can be harder to sell shares of the ETF at a fair price, which can result in larger bid-ask spreads and potential losses.

As with any investment, it's important to consider the risks as well as the potential rewards before investing in dividend ETFs. It's also a good idea to diversify your portfolio across different asset classes and investment strategies to help manage risk.
